#### Abstract 

Research in many fields is increasingly collaborative and data driven. Sharing and reuse of digital research knowledge requires generalised representations which afford uniform access, manipulation and reasoning across application contexts and domains. In this presentation, I will describe a knowledge representation framework based on dependent type theory which allows for the integration and logical description of distributed, heterogenous research data. In particular, I will discuss the advantages of using dependent type theory as a formal basis for communicating knowledge in the context of distributed, collaborative environments.
